Proposal:
For most of us, the computer is just about email, google, and regular word documents. But for those who have an understanding and knowledge about computer security, it's a portal to government websites, company databases, and people's lives. Malware and Viruses are more dangerous than ever and before.  Computer Security is not as simple as how it appears. It's backed with significant requirements that are surrounded mainly around the following labels: confidentiality, authentication, and nonrepudiation, or integrity. But the way to implement these mechanisms that meet those requirements can be quite tricky and even sometimes the understanding of it since it requires knowledge about the other side of the hand, the ugly side of the same coin, the negative aspect and reason of such existence, Malware, and Viruses. More than ever using intelligence science to solve these problems and the breach of security requirements require a deep understanding of the data from the block information that surrounds it. Such a thing can be done in the analysis of the biology behind it and the family that it was routed from. I would like to explore this matter further and see what are the modern ways that are in current use in the field of Cyber Security and Computer Science to identify and explore Malware and Viruses using AI and ML to help assist the different systems they were installed on for protection and mitigation of the risk. The topics that I will discuss and cover will surround things like the ways these AI are operating, implantation them, and computer network security relations. I have decided that I will go with is option #3 for final project. The plan will focus on reading papers on how AI can identify and track computer viruses in signal devices or systems. Research on which advantages of machine learning are more conducive to solving tracking viruses.
